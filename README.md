# Calorie Estimator AI 🍔🥗

An image-based food nutrition analysis system that uses deep learning to identify food items from photos and estimate their macronutrient content (calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fats).

## Project Overview

This project implements a two-stage pipeline:

1. **Food Classification** — A fine-tuned CNN (EfficientNet/ResNet-50) classifies the food item in the image
2. **Nutrition Estimation** — The predicted food category is mapped to a nutritional database to retrieve macronutrient values

## Dataset

We use the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101), which contains 101,000 images across 101 food categories.

## Setup & Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arsham-shirkouhi/Calorie_Estimator_AI.git
cd Calorie_Estimator_AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App

```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```

## Model Performance (Preliminary)

| Model        | Accuracy | Average loss |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| ResNet-50    | 91.5%    | 0.415        |
| EfficientNet | 90.56%   | 0.247        |

Both models achieved relatively similar accuracy after 3 epochs of training on a 10,000-image subset of Food-101. ResNet-50 achieved slightly higher accuracy (91.5%) while EfficientNet-B0 converged faster and reached a lower average training loss (~0.25 per batch vs ~0.41 per batch), suggesting better generalization potential with more training data. Based on these results, EfficientNet-B0 is the preferred model for our final pipeline due to its efficiency and lower loss.

## Prediction Pipeline Status

The inference backend now connects image classification with nutrition lookup so a single image input can return both the predicted food class and its nutritional profile per 100g.

### Completed Updates

- Implemented EfficientNet-B0 model construction in `src/model.py` for 101 Food-101 classes.
- Implemented `predict_food()` in `src/predict.py` with:
  - model weight loading from `models/best_model.pth`
  - image preprocessing (224x224 resize + ImageNet normalization)
  - class prediction and confidence score output
- Implemented `get_nutrition()` in `src/predict.py` to map predicted classes to `data/nutrition_database.csv`.
- Added CLI execution flow in `src/predict.py` to print:
  - predicted class
  - confidence percentage
  - calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sugar, sodium

### What Happens Next

- Train EfficientNet-B0 on a larger subset or full Food-101 dataset and save the best checkpoint to `models/best_model.pth`.
- Evaluate with validation metrics beyond training accuracy (precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix).
- Integrate this backend pipeline into `app/app.py` so Streamlit can perform end-to-end food nutrition estimation from uploaded images.
